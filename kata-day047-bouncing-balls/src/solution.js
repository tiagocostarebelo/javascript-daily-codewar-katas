/**
 * Problem statement:
 *
 * A child is playing with a ball on the nth floor of a tall building. The height of this floor above 
 * ground level, h, is known.
 * He drops the ball out of the window. The ball bounces (for example), to two-thirds of its height (a 
 * bounce of 0.66).
 * 
 * His mother looks out of a window 1.5 meters from the ground.
 * 
 * How many times will the mother see the ball pass in front of her window (including when it's falling 
 * and bouncing)?
 * 
 * Three conditions must be met for a valid experiment:
 * Float parameter "h" in meters must be greater than 0
 * Float parameter "bounce" must be greater than 0 and less than 1
 * Float parameter "window" must be less than h.
 * If all three conditions above are fulfilled, return a positive integer, otherwise return -1.
 * 
 * Note:
 * The ball can only be seen if the height of the rebounding ball is strictly greater than the window 
 * parameter.
 *
 * @param { h } number - The height of the building
 * @param { b } number - The bounce value of the ball
 * @param { w } number - The window height
 * @returns { count } The number of times the ball passes the window height
 * 
 * @example
 * bouncingBall([2.0, 0.5, 1]); // Returns: 1
