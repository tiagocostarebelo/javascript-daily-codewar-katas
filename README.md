# JavaScript CodeWars Challenge

A personal collection of daily **Codewars Katas** challenges written in **JavaScript (ES6+)**.  
Each kata includes my approach, final solution, and test cases built with **Jest**.  

The goal is to strengthen problem-solving skills, improve code readability, and practice consistency through daily coding.

---

## Challenge Goal

I’m committing to solving **one Codewars kata per day**, documenting each solution and reflection.  
This practice helps sharpen algorithmic thinking and reinforces clean, modular JavaScript habits.

```
npm install
```

```

**Testing:** Jest

**Platform:** CodeWars

**Version Control:** Git + GitHub

## Learning Focus
Each challenge reinforces:

Problem breakdown and algorithmic thinking

Clean, modular, and readable JavaScript
