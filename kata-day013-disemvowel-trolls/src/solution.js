/**
 * Problem statement:
 * 
 * Trolls are attacking your comment section!
 * A common way to deal with this situation is to remove all of the vowels from the trolls' comments, neutralizing the threat.
 * Your task is to write a function that takes a string and return a new string with all vowels removed.
 * For example, the string "This website is for losers LOL!" would become "Ths wbst s fr lsrs LL!".
 * Note: for this kata y isn't considered a vowel.
 * 
 * @param { str } string - The provided string
 * @returns { string  } Returns the string without vowels
 * 
 * @example
 * disemvowel("Hello") // Returns "hll"
 *
