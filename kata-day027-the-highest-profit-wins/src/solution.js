/**
 * Problem statement:
 *
 * Ben has a very simple idea to make some profit: he buys something and sells it again. 
 * Of course, this wouldn't give him any profit at all if he was simply to buy and sell it at the same price. Instead, he's 
 * going to buy it for the lowest possible price and sell it at the highest.
 * 
 * Write a function that returns both the minimum and maximum number of the given list/array.
 * 
 * All arrays or lists will always have at least one element, so you don't need to check the length. Also, your function will always get an array or a list, you don't have to check for null, undefined or similar.
 *
 * @param { arr } array - Given array of numbers
 * @returns { array } Return is an array with the minimum and maximum value in the given array
 *
 * @example
 * minMax([1,2,3,4,5]); // Returns: [1,5]
 */

export function minMax(arr) {
    return [Math.min(...arr), Math.max(...arr)];
}
